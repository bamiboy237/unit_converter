# Unit Converter Flask App
I recently started learning Flask(and modules such as flask wtf, wtf-forms) and decided to build a simple web application that would help me test my understanding. This web app allows users to convert various units of measurement, including temperature, length, and more.

## Features
This web app allows you to convert between different units of temperature (Celsius, Fahrenheit, Kelvin), various units of length (millimeters, centimeters, meters, kilometers, inches, feet, yards, miles) and weight(kilograms, grams, pounds, ounces, milligrams

## Technologies Used
I built the backend using Python's web app framework and some HTML and CSS to style and structure the frontend

## Installation

To run this application locally, follow these steps:
- run " git clone https://github.com/bamiboy237/unit_converter.git" on your terminal
- create a virtual environment and install flask, flask-wtf, wtfforms and then run "flask run"
